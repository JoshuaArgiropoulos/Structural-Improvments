# Structural-Improvments

The purpose of this project is to reinforce good coding practices such as encapsulation and in addition to fully utilizing OOP. 

This includes 
-polymorphism
-using const wherever possible
-No attribute can be declared more than once
-Attributes in classes must be private to ensure encapsulation 
-Instantiated objects cannot have attributes that are not initialized, nullptr, empty strings or zero.
-Using accessors to access private vairbles 
-Each class must have its own destructor to manage memeory 
-Must be allowed to add more shape classes in the future without having to alter the existing hierarchy, (OOP friendly, easy to expand)
